## Step 2: Open a Keyboard File with Wave Xtractor 3.2
 
Launch Wave Xtractor 3.2 and click on the "Open" button on the toolbar. Browse to the folder where you have stored your keyboard files and select one of them. For this example, we will use a KORG PA STY file called "Ballad.STY".
 
Wave Xtractor 3.2 will display the contents of the file in a tree view on the left panel. You can expand or collapse the nodes to see the details of each element. For example, you can see that the "Ballad.STY" file contains four variations (A-D), two fills (1-2), an intro and an ending.
 
## Step 3: Preview and Extract Audio Samples from Keyboard File
 
To preview an audio sample from the keyboard file, select it on the tree view and click on the "Play" button on the toolbar. You can also use the spacebar to play or pause the sample. You can adjust the volume and pan using the sliders on the bottom panel.
 
To extract an audio sample from the keyboard file, select it on the tree view and click on the "Extract" button on the toolbar. You can also right-click on it and choose "Extract" from the context menu. A dialog box will appear where you can choose a destination folder and a file name for the extracted WAV file. Click on "Save" to export the sample.
 
You can repeat this process for any other audio samples that you want to extract from the keyboard file. You can also select multiple samples at once by holding down the Ctrl or Shift key while clicking on them.
 
## Step 4: Edit and Customize Audio Samples with Audio Editor
 
Wave Xtractor 3.2 also comes with an audio editor that allows you to customize and edit your extracted samples before exporting them to WAV files. To access it, click on the "Audio Editor" button on the toolbar or press F4.
 
The audio editor will open in a new window where you can see a waveform representation of your selected sample. You can use various tools and effects to modify your sample, such as cut, copy, paste, trim, fade in/out, normalize, reverse, pitch shift, time stretch, reverb, chorus, flanger and more.
 
To apply an effect to your sample, select it on the waveform and click on one of the buttons on the top panel. A dialog box will appear where you can adjust the parameters of the effect. Click on "OK" to apply it.
 
To save your edited sample as a WAV file, click on the "Save As"
