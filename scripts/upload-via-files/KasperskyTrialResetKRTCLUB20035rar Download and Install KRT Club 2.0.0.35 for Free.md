## How to Use Kaspersky Trial Reset KRT CLUB 2.0.0.35?
 
Before using Kaspersky Trial Reset KRT CLUB 2.0.0.35, you need to download it from a reliable source[^3^] [^4^] [^5^]. Make sure you scan the file with your antivirus software before running it, as some sources may contain malware or viruses.
 
Once you have downloaded the file, follow these steps to use it:
 
1. Turn off Kaspersky's protection by going to Settings > Additional > Self-Defense and unchecking the "Enable Self-Defense" option[^1^] [^2^].
2. Close Kaspersky completely from the taskbar (right-click on the icon and click Exit).
3. Unzip the file KRT\_CLUB\_3.1.0.29\_ATB\_Ru\_Final\_v4.zip (or the English version if you prefer) and run it as administrator.
4. If the program is cleared by your system protection or Kaspersky protection, add it to the whitelist and try again[^1^] [^2^].
5. Click on "Activation reset" and confirm by clicking "Yes" in the pop-up window[^1^] [^2^]. The program will modify your system time temporarily and restart your computer automatically.
6. After restarting your computer, open Kaspersky and click on "Activate trial version of the application" in the activation window[^1^] [^2^]. Enter "2222-2222-2222-222U" as the key (for PURE 3.0, ignore this step)[^1^] [^2^].
7. You have successfully reset your trial period and extended your license for another 31 days[^1^] [^2^]. Enjoy!

Note: Remember to re-enable the "Self-Defense" option after rebooting[^1^] [^2^]. You can also switch to the advanced UI by pressing Ctrl+Alt keys and access more features such as saving or restoring your activation info[^2^]. You can repeat this process every time your trial period expires.
