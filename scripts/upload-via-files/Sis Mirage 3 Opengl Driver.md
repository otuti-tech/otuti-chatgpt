# How to Install Sis Mirage 3 Opengl Driver on Windows 10
 
If you have a laptop or desktop computer with a Sis Mirage 3 graphics card, you may have encountered some problems with running OpenGL applications on Windows 10. OpenGL is a cross-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics, and it is widely used by many games and software programs. However, the Sis Mirage 3 graphics card does not support OpenGL natively, and the default driver that comes with Windows 10 does not provide OpenGL support either. This means that you may experience low performance, graphical glitches, or even crashes when trying to run OpenGL applications on your computer.
 
Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem. You can install a custom driver that enables OpenGL support for your Sis Mirage 3 graphics card on Windows 10. This driver is based on the Mesa 3D project, which is an open-source implementation of OpenGL. By installing this driver, you can enjoy better compatibility and performance with OpenGL applications on your computer.
