## How to Load the Instruments and Combinators
 
The Miroslav String Ensembles Refill.rfl is located in the Reason Factory Sound Bank, under the Orkester folder. To load an instrument or a combinator, you need to create a NN-XT sampler or a Combinator device in your rack. Then, you can browse the refill and drag and drop the instrument or combinator patch into the device. You can also use the patch browser on the device to select the patch you want.
 
The instruments are organized into two folders: Ensemble Strings and Solo Strings. The Ensemble Strings folder contains 95 instruments, divided into four subfolders: Full Strings, High Strings, Low Strings, and String Sections. The Solo Strings folder contains 100 instruments, divided into five subfolders: Cello, Double Bass, Viola, Violin, and Violin 2. Each instrument has a name that indicates the articulation and style of the string sound, such as Legato, Staccato, Pizzicato, Tremolo, etc.
 
The combinators are organized into three folders: Ensemble Strings Combinators, Solo Strings Combinators, and String FX Combinators. The Ensemble Strings Combinators folder contains 86 combinators, divided into four subfolders: Full Strings Combinators, High Strings Combinators, Low Strings Combinators, and String Sections Combinators. The Solo Strings Combinators folder contains 75 combinators, divided into five subfolders: Cello Combinators, Double Bass Combinators, Viola Combinators, Violin Combinators, and Violin 2 Combinators. The String FX Combinators folder contains 16 combinators that create various effects and textures with the string sounds.
 
Each combinator has a name that indicates the combination of instruments and effects used in the patch, such as Full Strings Legato Warm Reverb, Violin Pizzicato Delay Chorus, String FX Glissando Pad, etc. Each combinator also has four knobs and four buttons on the front panel that allow you to control different parameters of the sound, such as volume, pan, reverb, filter, envelope, modulation, etc. You can see the function of each knob and button by hovering your mouse over them.
