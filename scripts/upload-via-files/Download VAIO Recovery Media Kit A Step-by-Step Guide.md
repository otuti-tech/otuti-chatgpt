### If Your PC Does Not Have a Recovery Partition
 
If your PC does not have a recovery partition, or if it has been deleted or corrupted, you cannot create a recovery media kit from it. In this case, you have two options:

- If you have created a recovery media kit before and still have it, you can use it to restore your PC. Simply insert the disc or USB flash drive into your PC and follow the instructions on the screen.
- If you have not created a recovery media kit before, or if you have lost or misplaced it, you can use the Recovery Media Distribution Service from VAIO Corporation. This service allows you to order a recovery media kit for your specific model online for a fee. The fee includes the cost of the Microsoft operating system license. To use this service, please contact VAIO customer service at 1-800-433-5778.
