The film follows Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, as he faces a new threat from the Ministry of Magic, which is in denial of Lord Voldemort's return. Harry also forms a secret group of students, called Dumbledore's Army, to teach them how to defend themselves against the dark arts.
 
The film was released in 2D cinemas and IMAX formats in July 2007, and received generally positive reviews from critics. It was praised for its darker tone, mature themes, performances, visual effects, and action sequences. It was also a huge commercial success, grossing over $942 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 2007.
 
However, some fans and critics criticized the film for its deviations from the book, such as omitting or altering some characters, subplots, and scenes. The film also faced some controversy for its use of Hollywood accounting, as Warner Bros. claimed that it lost $167 million despite its high gross.
 
Overall, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a thrilling and engaging adaptation of Rowling's novel, that showcases Harry's growth as a leader and a hero. It is a must-watch for fans of the franchise, and a great introduction for newcomers. The film is available to stream on Netflix with English subtitles.

The film begins with Harry and his cousin Dudley being attacked by Dementors in a suburban street. Harry manages to repel them with a Patronus spell, but is soon expelled from Hogwarts for using magic outside school. He is also visited by a group of wizards from the Order of the Phoenix, a secret organization founded by Dumbledore to fight Voldemort and his followers. They take him to their headquarters at 12 Grimmauld Place, where he meets Sirius Black, his godfather and a fugitive from the Ministry.
 
Harry learns that the Ministry of Magic, led by Cornelius Fudge, is refusing to believe that Voldemort has returned, and is spreading lies about him and Dumbledore in the media. The Ministry also appoints a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts, Dolores Umbridge, who is actually a spy and a sadist. She imposes strict rules and punishments on the students, and teaches them only theoretical knowledge of the dark arts, without any practical skills.
 
Harry decides to take matters into his own hands, and forms a secret group of students who want to learn how to defend themselves. He calls them Dumbledore's Army, or DA for short, and teaches them various spells and techniques in a hidden room called the Room of Requirement. He also starts having visions of Voldemort and his actions, which he later realizes are connected to their minds being linked.
 
Meanwhile, Voldemort is searching for a mysterious prophecy that is hidden in the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic. The prophecy concerns Harry and Voldemort, and reveals that one of them must kill the other. Harry sees a vision of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries, and decides to go there with his friends to rescue him. However, they are ambushed by Death Eaters, Voldemort's loyal followers, who want to get the prophecy from Harry.
 
A fierce battle ensues between the DA and the Death Eaters, in which several characters are injured or killed. Harry manages to get the prophecy, but it is smashed during the fight. He also confronts Bellatrix Lestrange, the Death Eater who killed Sirius. He tries to use an unforgivable curse on her, but is stopped by Dumbledore, who arrives with other members of the Order to help them.
 
Dumbledore duels with Voldemort, while Harry struggles to resist Voldemort's influence on his mind. Voldemort tries to possess Harry, but fails because of Harry's love for his friends and family. He then flees with his Death Eaters, as Fudge and other Ministry officials witness his return. Fudge admits his mistake and resigns as Minister of Magic.
 
The film ends with Harry returning to Hogwarts with his friends. He learns that the prophecy stated that he is "the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord", and that neither can live while the other survives. He also learns that he has a special connection with Voldemort because of their shared blood. He vows to fight Voldemort until the end, and is comforted by his friends.
